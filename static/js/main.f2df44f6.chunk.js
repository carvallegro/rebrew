This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells can\'t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can\'t protrude into it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\'t function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration.\\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person, that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball, can\'t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough.\\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature or object is in it.\\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\\nA magic weapon\'s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere.\\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature occupied is no longer within the sphere.\\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different antimagic field spells don\'t nullify each other."},"Antipathy/Sympathy":{"name":"Antipathy/Sympathy","srd":true,"level_number":8,"school":"Enchantment","casting_time":"1 hour","range":"60 feet","components":"V, S, M","duration":"10 days","desc":"This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice.

Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura\'s effect.\\nAntipathy.\\n The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can\'t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can\'t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.\\nSympathy.\\n The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can\'t willingly move away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.\\nEnding the Effect.\\n If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.\\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again."},"Arcane Eye":{"name":"Arcane Eye","srd":true,"level_number":4,"school":"Divination","casting_time":"1 action","range":"30 feet","components":"V, S, M","duration":"Up to 1 hour","desc":"You create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the air for the duration.\\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has normal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet.

Make a check with the hand\'s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\\nGrasping Hand.\\n The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand\'s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\\nInterposing Hand.\\n The hand interposes itself between you and a creature you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target. The target can\'t move through the hand\'s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the hand\'s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the hand\'s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the hand\'s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target."},"Arcane Lock":{"name":"Arcane Lock","srd":true,"level_number":2,"school":"Abjuration","casting_time":"1 action","range":"Touch","components":"V, S, M","duration":"Until dispelled","desc":"You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes locked for the duration.

The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot.

Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely.

Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss.

By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very foundations of reality in accord with your desires.\\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th level or lower. You don\u2019t need to meet any requirements in that spell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your choice:\\n- You create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn\u2019t a magic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any dimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on the ground.\\n- You allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all hit points, and you end all effects on them described in the greater restoration spell.\\n- You grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a damage type you choose.\\n- You grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single spell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could make yourself and all your companions immune to a lich\u2019s life drain attack.\\n- You undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll made within the last round (including your last turn). Reality reshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a wish spell could undo an opponent\u2019s successful save, a foe\u2019s critical hit, or a friend\u2019s failed save. You can force the reroll to be made with advantage or disadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the original roll.\\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above examples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM has great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the greater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes wrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might only be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen consequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example, wishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to a period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing you from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or artifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item\u2019s current owner.\\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than duplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress, each time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take 1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can\u2019t be reduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to 3, if it isn\u2019t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those days that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light activity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally, there is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast wish ever again if you suffer this stress."},"Word of Recall":{"name":"Word of Recall","srd":true,"level_number":6,"school":"Conjuration","casting_time":"1 action","range":"5 feet","components":"V","duration":"Instantaneous","desc":"You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport to a previously designated sanctuary.
